# P8-TOURGUIDE
Project 8 - OpenClassrooms- Scale Up Your App With Distributed Systems

## Purpose
TourGuide is a Spring Boot application that has been a centerpiece in the TripMasters app portfolio. 
The application will be targeting people looking for package deals on hotel stays and admissions to various attractions. 

It now supports the tracking of 100.000 users in a bit more than 3 minutes and the calculation of reward points for 100.000 users in +-8,5 minutes.
As it is now, TripMaster can even go up to 235.000 users, under the requirements of 15 and 20 minutes each set at the beginning of the project's construction (for tracking locations and rewards).
## Getting Started
